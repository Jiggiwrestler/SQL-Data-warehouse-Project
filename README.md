## Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

📊 Data Warehouse Project 🚀 🎯 Objective The SalesSync Data Warehouse project aims to build a robust data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple sources, enabling powerful analytical reporting and informed decision-making for business stakeholders. 📈

🔍 Specifications

Data Sources 📥 ERP System: Structured transactional data extracted from the enterprise resource planning system. CSV Files: Supplementary sales data provided in CSV format. Approach: Seamlessly import data from both sources into the data warehouse for unified analysis.

Data Quality 🧹

Cleansing: Identify and resolve data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies, to ensure reliable analysis. Validation: Implement checks to maintain data integrity before loading into the warehouse.

Integration 🔗

Unified Data Model: Combine ERP and CSV data into a single, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries. Design: Create a schema that supports efficient querying and reporting, tailored to business needs.

Scope 📏

Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required. Prioritize current sales data to deliver timely insights.

Documentation 📝

Provide clear, comprehensive documentation of the data model, including: Schema diagrams (e.g., ERDs created in tools like draw.io‍.io). Detailed descriptions of tables, columns, and relationships.

Ensure accessibility for both business stakeholders and analytical teams to support effective use of the warehouse.

📊 Business Intelligence: Analytics & Reporting Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver actionable insights into:

Customer Behavior 🧑‍🤝‍🧑: Understand purchasing patterns and preferences. Product Performance 📦: Evaluate which products are driving sales and profitability. Sales Trends 📅: Identify seasonal patterns and growth opportunities.

These analytics will empower stakeholders with data-driven insights to optimize strategies and boost performance. 💡 📜 License This project is licensed under the MIT License 🆓, allowing free use, modification, and distribution with proper attribution.
